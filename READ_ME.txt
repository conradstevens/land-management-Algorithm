# land-management-Algorithm
Has application to large scale land management, particularly forestry and agriculture.

This program is in writen in python. Given any shaped map of plantable and unplantable land, a character will move about the land covering every plantable point and missing every unplantable point while using as few steps as possoble. Additionaly fuel can be added so the character can only take a finite number of steps before having to return to it's start location for fule.  
  
  Here is a link to a video titled “Land Management Algorithm” of the algorithm in action:

Orriginaly this had been a hard coded algorithm. Ufortunelty this code has been lost. I am now working to make directional decision making completly autonomus.

Jonathan scooter Clark, a leading member of the reforestiation community has spoken with me about mentioning the algorithm in the next version of his book: 'Step by Step, a guide to tree planting for beginners'.
